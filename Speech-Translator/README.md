Welcome to the **Speech Translator** project! 🌍🗣️

This project demonstrates how to leverage **Azure's multi-service capabilities** to build an intelligent **Speech Translator** system. It integrates **Speech-to-Text**, **Language Identification**, **Text Translation**, and **Text-to-Speech** to translate spoken language into another language and speak it out loud.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project utilizes **Azure Cognitive Services** to:

1. **Speech-to-Text**: Converts spoken language into written text.
2. **Language Identification**: Detects the language of the input text.
3. **Text Translation**: Translates the detected language into the target language.
4. **Text-to-Speech**: Converts the translated text back into speech.

With these features, you can speak in one language, and the system will translate and speak it back in another language, making communication across languages seamless! 🌐
